## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.7] - 2026-01-27

**Highlights**

- **Multi-Homey**: Supports multiple hubs with auto-rescope and collision-safe IDs. Single‑hub users are unaffected and keep existing devices as-is.
- **Logic Variables**: Numbers/booleans/strings now appear as entities. Ensure the API key includes `homey.logic.readonly` (and `homey.logic` for editing).
- **Options & Settings**: Manage API key/host updates and tune string exposure plus advanced behaviors from the integration options.

### Added
- **Homey Logic variables**: Import Logic numbers, booleans, and strings as Number, Switch, and Text entities
- **Multi-homey guardrails**: Multi-homey activates only when 2+ hubs exist, with auto-rescope when a new hub is added
- **Multi-homey unique IDs**: Entity and device identifiers are scoped per Homey hub to prevent collisions
- **User notifications**: Pending rescope, migration start/finish, duplicate hub detection
- **Read-only string sensors (default on)**: String capabilities can be exposed without enabling editable text inputs
- **Text entities (optional)**: Expose settable string capabilities as editable text inputs via integration options
- **Switch coverage**: Create switches for other settable boolean capabilities beyond `onoff`
- **Enum/string selects**: Select entities now support string/enum capabilities with proper titles
- **Capability reporting**: Notify when new capabilities appear with a prefilled GitHub issue link (auto-labeled `enhancement`)
- **Light temperature option**: Toggle to invert normalized `light_temperature` for devices with warm/cold reversed
- **Generic sensor coverage**: Create sensors for getable numeric/string capabilities beyond `measure_*` and `meter_*`
- **Heat pump counters**: Added compressor counter sensors (`compressor_hours`, `compressor_starts`)
- **Automation checks**: CI runs HASSfest, HACS, syntax, lint, type, test, and pre-commit checks

### Fixed
- **Cover controls**: Use enum `windowcoverings_state` for actions and `windowcoverings_set` for numeric position where available
- **Logic device retention**: Prevent device filter cleanup from removing the Homey Logic device
- **Entity registration conflicts**: Avoid duplicate entity warnings for multi-homey sensors
- **Entity migration gaps**: Entities without config entry linkage are migrated by legacy identifiers
- **Multi-homey device removal**: Prevent devices from disappearing when multiple Homeys are configured
- **Invert toggle persistence**: Light temperature inversion option now persists correctly in settings
- **Options persistence**: String exposure toggles now persist reliably across reloads
- **Binary sensor filtering**: Settable boolean capabilities no longer create duplicate binary sensors
- **Heat pump status entities**: Restored missing boolean entities (e.g., `compressor_active`, `circulation_pump`, `hot_water`)
- **Cover stop error**: Fixed `UnboundLocalError` when stopping enum-based curtains
- **Service setup error**: Fixed `vol` import scoping issue during integration setup
- **Light temperature default**: Invert normalized `light_temperature` by default (warm/cold correction)
- **Light color temperature**: Expose color temperature mode even when saturation is missing
- **CI type checks**: Mypy is enforced again after fixing type errors

### Notes
- **Single Homey users**: No change needed — the integration works as before
- **Multiple Homeys**: When a second hub is added, entities are re-scoped to avoid collisions and device visibility issues
- **Missing status strings**: If you can’t see status/notification strings, check the string toggles in settings; you can disable them if you don’t want those entities

## [1.1.6] - 2026-01-15

### 🚀 Major Real-Time Updates Release

**This is a significant update that transforms the integration from polling-based to real-time event-driven updates. Device state changes in Homey now appear in Home Assistant instantly (< 1 second) instead of waiting for the next poll cycle (previously 10 seconds). This provides a truly responsive smart home experience where actions taken in Homey (via app, physical switches, or automations) are immediately reflected in Home Assistant's UI.**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: API Key Requirement**
- **This feature requires a new API key with the `homey.system.readonly` permission enabled**
- Go to **Homey Settings → API Keys** and **create a new API key**
- Enable the **System → View System** permission (`homey.system.readonly`)
- After creating the new API key, update your Home Assistant integration configuration with the new key and restart Home Assistant or reload the Homey integration
- Without this permission, Socket.IO real-time updates will not work and the integration will fall back to polling
- The integration will continue to work with polling if the permission is missing, but you won't get instant updates

**What This Really Means:**
- **Before**: When you turned on a light in Homey, Home Assistant would show the old state until the next poll (up to 10 seconds later)
- **After**: When you turn on a light in Homey, Home Assistant updates instantly (< 1 second) - the UI reflects reality in real-time
- **Bidirectional**: Commands sent from Home Assistant to Homey also get instant feedback, so you see the result immediately
- **Seamless**: If Socket.IO connection fails, the integration automatically falls back to polling (5-10 seconds) - you never lose updates
- **Efficient**: When Socket.IO is active, polling reduces to 60 seconds (safety net), saving API calls while maintaining reliability

### Added
- **Socket.IO Real-Time Updates**: Full support for real-time device updates via Socket.IO
  - Integration now uses Socket.IO for instant device state updates when available
  - Device changes in Homey (via app, physical switches, or automations) appear in Home Assistant immediately (< 1 second)
  - Socket.IO provides bidirectional communication for instant feedback on control commands
  - Automatic fallback to polling (every 5 seconds) if Socket.IO connection fails or disconnects
  - Seamless reconnection: Socket.IO automatically reconnects if connection is lost
  - Connection status clearly logged: INFO when Socket.IO connects, WARNING when it disconnects and polling takes over
  - Polling continues as backup even when Socket.IO is active, ensuring updates are never missed
  - Works with both local Homey devices and self-hosted Homey servers
- **Options & Reauth flows**: Update Homey host/IP, API key, and fallback polling settings without reinstalling
- **Reauthentication flow**: Prompts for a new API key when credentials are invalid
- **Auto-recovery**: Integration reconnects automatically after Homey restarts or network drops
- **Devicegroups plugin support**: Groups are detected and handled based on class/capabilities (lights, fans, switches, climate, covers)
- **Energy dashboard compatibility**: Energy sensors now use proper device_class/state_class and kWh units
- **Price sensor unit normalization**: Tibber sensors normalize currency units (SEK/EUR/USD) to `/kWh`
- **Accumulated cost currency detection**: Auto-detects currency for `accumulatedCost`
- **Battery device support**: Full sensor mapping for Homey battery devices
- **Lawn mower support**: Gardena lawn mower buttons and sensors
- **Heat pump support**: Expanded heat pump capabilities, programs, and sensors
- **Generic boolean binary sensors**: All boolean capabilities detected (not only alarm_*)
- **Number pattern matching**: Auto-detects numeric settable sub-capabilities (target_temperature.*)

### Fixed
- **Cover position feature**: Use compatible position feature flags to avoid attribute errors on older HA versions
- **Enum-based windowcoverings support**: Proper enum handling for `windowcoverings_state` (up/idle/down)
- **Device selection defaults**: All devices are selected by default in the setup flow
- **Transient outages**: Prevents device removals when the API temporarily returns no devices
- **Self-hosted SSL support**: Proper HTTPS handling for Homey self-hosted servers
- **Vacuum compatibility**: Updated vacuum entity to HA 2026.1 API
- **Light detection for socket-class devices**: Dimmable/socket-class devices now detected as lights
- **Sensor labeling**: Corrected energy vs power sensor labels
- **Cover operation handling**: Improved handling for `windowcoverings_set` and cover operations
- **Area assignment**: Preserves user-assigned areas; only updates integration-set areas
- **Indentation/stability fixes**: Multiple platform files now load cleanly without syntax errors

### Changed
- **Socket.IO logging**: Reduced per-update log noise (kept only key status)

- Scenes use device permissions (no separate scene permissions in Homey API v3)

#### Humidity Conversion Logic
- Automatically detects if humidity values are normalized (0-1) or percentage (0-100) based on capability `max` value
- Converts normalized values to percentage when reading
- Converts percentage to normalized values when writing
- Applies to both `measure_humidity` sensors and `target_humidity` climate controls

#### Feature Availability Handling
- Empty results (200 OK with empty data) are treated as normal - user just doesn't have that feature configured
- Permission errors (401/403) trigger warnings and disable features
- 404 errors are treated as feature not available on this Homey version
- Integration never breaks due to missing features or permissions

**Impact**: This release significantly expands the integration's capabilities, adding support for scenes, moods, and many new sensor types. The permission system ensures users understand what features require which permissions, and the integration gracefully handles all edge cases.

- **Fixed flow discovery** - Flows now properly appear as button entities in Home Assistant
- **Fixed flow triggering** - Both Standard and Advanced Flows can now be triggered successfully

### Added
- **Advanced Flows support** - Added support for Homey Advanced Flows using `/api/manager/flow/advancedflow` endpoint
- **Improved flow discovery** - Now fetches both Standard and Advanced Flows separately and combines them
- **Case-insensitive flow name matching** - Flow names can now be matched regardless of case when using service calls
- **Update guide** - Added comprehensive update instructions to README

### Changed
- **Reduced verbose logging** - Removed excessive debug logs for cleaner production logs
- **Improved flow error messages** - Better error messages when flows are not found, including list of available flows
- **Enhanced flow triggering** - Automatically uses correct endpoint (standard vs advanced) based on flow type

### Technical Details
- Standard Flows: `/api/manager/flow/flow` endpoint
- Advanced Flows: `/api/manager/flow/advancedflow` endpoint
- Flow type detection: Automatically marks flows as "standard" or "advanced" for correct endpoint usage
- Flow name matching: Now supports both exact match and case-insensitive matching

**Impact**: This fix resolves issues where flows were not appearing or could not be triggered, especially on Homey Pro 2026. All users with flows should update to this version.

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-08

### 🎨 Major Fix: Light Color Control

**This version includes a critical fix for light color control that was preventing colors from changing correctly.**

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: API Key Update Required

**Before upgrading to version 1.0.1, you MUST create a new API key in Homey with the following permissions:**

1. Go to **Homey Web App** → **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Create a **new API key** (or update your existing one)
3. Ensure these permissions are enabled:
   - `device:read` - Required to read device states
   - `device:write` - Required to control devices
   - `zone:read` - **Required for room/area organization** (recommended)
   - `flow:read` - **Required for Flow support** (needed to list Flows and create button entities)
   - `flow:write` - **Required for Flow support** (needed to trigger Flows)
4. Update your Home Assistant integration configuration with the new API key

**Why?** This version includes improvements that require proper API permissions. Without `zone:read`, devices won't be organized by rooms. Without `device:write`, you won't be able to control devices. Without `flow:read` and `flow:write`, Flow support (button entities and service calls) will be disabled.

### Added
- Manual device deletion support - users can now delete devices from the Devices page
- Device selection during initial setup - choose which devices to import
- Post-setup device management - add/remove devices via integration options
- Device filtering - only selected devices are imported and managed

### Changed
- Removed emojis from device selection UI for better compatibility
- Improved error handling for 401 authentication errors - now tries all endpoints before failing
- Enhanced device value conversion to prevent "invalid literal for int()" errors
- Improved room/zone detection - gracefully handles missing zone permissions
- Updated config flow to handle missing zones/rooms gracefully
- Reduced polling interval from 30 seconds to 10 seconds for faster background updates
- Implemented immediate device state refresh after control commands for instant UI feedback (1-2 seconds)
- Improved logging - reduced excessive debug logging for production use
- Enhanced color control error handling - better error messages and logging for troubleshooting color issues

### Fixed
- **Fixed light color control** - Colors now change correctly! The issue was a value format mismatch between Home Assistant (hue 0-360°, saturation 0-100%) and Homey API (normalized 0-1). The integration now automatically converts between these formats.
- Fixed light color mode validation - prevents "invalid supported color modes" warnings by correctly handling color mode combinations
- Improved color setting reliability - ensures light is turned on before setting color, sets saturation before hue, and enforces minimum brightness for color visibility
- Fixed schema serialization errors in config flow (`cv.multi_select` instead of boolean checkboxes)
- Fixed authentication flow - no longer fails immediately on first 401 error
- Fixed device registry updates - devices now properly sync names and areas
- Fixed device deletion - devices removed from Homey are now properly cleaned up
- Fixed deprecated constants (`ATTR_COLOR_TEMP_KELVIN`, removed `UnitOfVoltage`)
- Fixed coordinator update interval - now uses `timedelta` instead of `int`
- Fixed binary sensor device class - removed unsupported `CO2` device class
- Fixed thermostat temperature sync - now properly syncs back to Homey
- Fixed motion/contact sensor state updates - improved value parsing
- Fixed cover position handling - better handling of missing capability values
- Fixed flow triggering - tries multiple endpoints and HTTP methods
- Fixed missing `Any` import in `__init__.py`
- Fixed OptionsFlow initialization error (`AttributeError: property 'config_entry' has no setter`)
- Fixed missing `CONF_DEVICE_FILTER` import in coordinator causing `NameError`
- Fixed status update delays - status now updates immediately after control commands instead of waiting for polling cycle

### Technical Details
- Added automatic value format conversion for `light_hue` and `light_saturation` capabilities
- Home Assistant format → Homey API format: hue (0-360° → 0-1), saturation (0-100% → 0-1)
- Homey API format → Home Assistant format: hue (0-1 → 0-360°), saturation (0-1 → 0-100%)
- Updated API reference documentation to reflect Homey's normalized value format (0-1) for many capabilities

**Impact**: This fix resolves a critical issue where light colors would not change or would change incorrectly. All users with color-capable lights should update to this version.

### Known Issues
- **Room/Zone Detection**: Room grouping may not work if API key doesn't have `zone:read` permission. Devices will still be imported but without room grouping.
- **Config Flow Window Size**: Home Assistant config flow dialogs have a fixed size and cannot be customized. This is a Home Assistant limitation.
- **Socket.IO Real-time Updates**: Currently disabled due to authentication complexity. Using polling instead (10-second intervals) with immediate refresh after control commands for near-instant feedback.
- **Entity Name Updates**: Entity names (`_attr_name`) don't update automatically when device names change in Homey. Device names in UI will update, but entity names require integration reload.
- **External Changes**: Changes made outside Home Assistant (via Homey app or physical switches) may take up to 10 seconds to appear in Home Assistant due to polling interval.
